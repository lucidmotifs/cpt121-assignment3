 * 
 * This code is the implementation of the Attraction class for CPT121 
 * Assignment 3 in SP2, 2015.
 * 
 * You are expected to work off this sample implementation of the Attraction
 * class - you *DO NOT* need to implement your own version of this class.
 * 
 * You may need to amend the functionality of this class to cater for exception
 * handling requirements in Stage 5 and perhaps for file handling functionality
 * in the bonus marks stage.
